# Discord Minesweeper
A python script to generate minesweeper fields to paste into discord.
I saw people creating minesweeper fields in discord using the new spoiler tag, so I thought I would make a script to make the fields automatically.

Run the script, enter how large the square should be, then enter how many bombs to place in the field.
It will generate the text to copy and paste right into a discord chat.
